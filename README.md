# bluepill_uart_dma
I have created this project to support newcomers to the STM32 platform.
During realization of your project you can find it useful, since you can send debug messages via UART with 
a very small effort. Sending the messages with UART using DMA to reduce CPU overhead.

In case you want to check what modifications I have made to a newly generated project, please search for the string:
 - // CUSTOM CODE FOLLOWS

So use it to study DMA handling or as a quick start template if you wish.
